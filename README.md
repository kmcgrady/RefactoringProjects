# Refactoring Java Projects

This project contains code samples that illustrates violations of some important object oriented principles in lecture. These principles are:

* Law of Demeter
* Single-Responsibility Principle
* Open-Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

## Requirements

* Only requirement is Java 8 or later. You may need to set the JDK version in IntelliJ.

## Setup

Each code sample is entirely runnable. If you want to run all of them, run the file `src/com.ga/Main.java`. You can also run each code sample at a time in `src/com.ga/code/codesampleX/CodeSampleXMain` where `X` is the current number.

## Instructions

With your group, look at each code sample and identify which principles the code violates. Keep in mind that multiple principles can be violated. Start a conversation and talk about why you think it is.

If you have more time at the end, try to refactor each code sample to satisfy the principle.

Good Luck!
